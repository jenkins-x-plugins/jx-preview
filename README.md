`jx-preview` is a small command line tool for creating Preview Environments in [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/)

## Overview

The [jx preview create](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-preview/blob/master/docs/cmd/jx-preview_create.md) command will create a new Preview environment, by default in its own unique namespace called `jx-$owner-$repo-pr-$number` using a [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) located by default in the `preview/helmfile.yaml` directory.

New projects created with [Jenkins X 3.x](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/v3/) already have the `preview/helmfile.yaml` included. If your repository does not include this file it will be added into git in the Pull Request as an extra commit.
    
## System tests in previews

If you wish to use a preview environment to run tests and interacting with the preview you can source the `.jx/variables.sh` file to then be able to interact with the preview via the `PREVIEW_*` environment variables.

e.g.

```yaml 
- name: test-preview
  image: golang:1.17.9
  script: |
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    source .jx/variables.sh
    curl -v $PREVIEW_URL
```
           
### Environment variables

The following variables are added to the `.jx/variables.sh` file by the `jx preview create` command:
   
* `PREVIEW_URL` the URL of the preview environment if it can be discovered
* `PREVIEW_NAME` the name of the `Preview` custom resource which has the full metadata
* `PREVIEW_NAMESPACE` the namespace of the preview environment which you can use via `myservice.$PREVIEW_NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local` to access services in your preview

## How it works

Creating a new preview environment creates a [Preview](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-preview/blob/master/docs/crds/github-com-jenkins-x-jx-preview-pkg-apis-preview-v1alpha1.md#Preview) custom resource for each Pull Request on each repository so that we can track the resources and cleanly remove them when you run [jx preview destroy](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-preview/blob/master/docs/cmd/jx-preview_destroy.md) pr [jx preview gc](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-preview/blob/master/docs/cmd/jx-preview_gc.md)

For reference see the [Preview.Spec](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-preview/blob/master/docs/crds/github-com-jenkins-x-jx-preview-pkg-apis-preview-v1alpha1.md#PreviewSpec) documentation


## Installation

If you are using [Jenkins X 3.x](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/v3/) then its already included by default so there's nothing to install.

If you are not using [Jenkins X 3.x](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/v3/) then you need to install the `jx3/jx-preview` chart to:

* install the [Preview](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-preview/blob/master/docs/crds/github-com-jenkins-x-jx-preview-pkg-apis-preview-v1alpha1.md#Preview) custom resource used to track the Preview environments
* setups a `CronJob`  to garbage collect `Preview` environments when the Pull Requests have been closed or merged 


To install the `jx3/jx-preview` chart using [helm 3.x](https://helm.sh/) try the following::


- Add jx3 helm charts repo

```bash
helm repo add jx3 https://storage.googleapis.com/jenkinsxio/charts

helm repo update
```

- Install (or upgrade)

```bash
# This will install jx-preview in the jx namespace (with a jx-preview release name)

helm upgrade --install jx-preview --namespace jx jx3/jx-preview
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall the chart, simply delete the release.

```bash
# This will uninstall jx-preview in the jx-preview namespace (assuming a jx-preview release name)

# Helm v3
helm uninstall jx-preview --namespace jx
```

## Debug
To debug jx preview inside a Running container:
First modify you pipeline by editing `pullrequest.yaml`  in your project,
before jx preview add:
```shell script
while true
do
  echo "waiting for debug"
  sleep 30
done
```
build your version of jx preview locally, and copy it inside the container
```shell script
make build
kubectl cp ./build/jx-preview pr-xxxxxxxx:/ -c step-promote-jx-preview
```
once the pipeline reaches the promote-jx-preview step, exec into the container:
```shell script
kubectl exec -it pr-xxxxxxxx -c step-promote-jx-preview -- sh
```
and run:
```shell script
apk update
apk add go
go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
```
then debug your binary using dlv (you can change create with gc...)
```shell script
source /workspace/source/.jx/variables.sh # copied from pipeline
/tekton/home/go/bin/dlv --listen=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 exec /jx-preview create
```
redirect traffic from your port 2345 to the container in another terminal
```shell script
kubectl port-forward pr-xxxxxxxx 2345
```
attach your debugger and happy debugging.

Do not forget to `make build` and `kubectl cp` after each change
